# Election_Analysis-Callenge Module 3

## Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Board of Elections and it's team members Seth and Tom asked us to run the election audit so that they can submit the election audit results to the election commission. Initially, they asked us to find the total number of votes casted, a complete list of candidates who received votes, total number of votes each candidate received, percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.  Later, they had also asked for the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Results

We used python for this project to run and calculates the results.  We used Visual Studio to write and run our python code. , Our final Python script delivered the following results:

* Total number of votes cast: 369,711
* Three candidates with total number of votes each candidate received and percentage of votes each candidate are:

     Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
     Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
     Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
     
* The winning candidate's details are as follow:

    Winner: Diana DeGette
    Winning Vote Count: 272,892
    Winning Percentage: 73.8%
    
* The county results are as follow:
    
    Jefferson : 10.5% (38,855)
    Denver : 82.8% (306,055)
    Arapahoe : 6.7% (24,801)
    
* The largest county votes turnout was in Denver.

## Election-Audit Summary: 
Our python script can be beneficial for the election commission to use to audit election results with few modifications. 
It can be used in counting total votes, candidates, each candidate's vote count as well as the percentage, and the winner. This can be achieved through changing the data source file in csv file format. The script can also be further modified to count the votes each candidate received from each county.
